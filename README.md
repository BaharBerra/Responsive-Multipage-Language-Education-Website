This project, LANGUBUBU, is a fully responsive, multi-page language education website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6). It serves as a comprehensive tutorial for beginners in web development, demonstrating how to build a modern language education website from scratch. The website includes several essential sections and features to provide a complete and user-friendly experience.
